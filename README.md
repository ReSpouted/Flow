# launcherapi
This is the API used by the legacy launcher. Later it will probably be updated to be used with the newer launcher too if it needs one too

## Running locally
```
$ make init
```

## License
Consider it as proprietary for now, we havent discussed about this with the ReSpouted team. This will probably be GPLv3 unless someone opposes
